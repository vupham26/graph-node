/// This struct is intended to prevent deadlocks that can occur when
/// acquiring a pooled db connection. A deadlock can occur whenever
/// a task attempts to acquire a pooled connection while already holding one.
/// Consider the case for a pooled connection and a pool size of 2:
///
/// fn() deadlock() {
///    let conn1 = acquire();
///    sleep(1000);
///    let conn2 = acquire();
/// }
///
/// If the above is called by two threads at the same time, both will
/// acquire conn1, but will not be able to acquire conn2 because
/// the pool is empty and neither thread can progress far enough to drop
/// conn1 leaving them both stuck.
///
/// The case above is relatively easy to monitor, but when the code
/// gets complex this is harder to detect. Consider for instance
/// if conn2 was acquired deep in the call stack through several
/// indirect function calls or even in other tasks.
///
/// TODO: Explain how this fixes the problem
